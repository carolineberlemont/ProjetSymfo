titleWelcomeLouvre : Welcome to the Louvre Museum
descriptionMuseum1 : The Louvre Museum, inaugurated in 1793 as the Central Museum of the Republic's arts in the Louvre Palace, former royal residence located in the center of Paris, is today the largest museum of art and antiques in the world. Its exhibition area is 72,735 m26.
                        By the end of 2016, its collections included 554,731 works, including 35,000 exhibits and 264,486 graphic works. These show the Western art of the Middle Ages to 1848, that of the ancient civilizations that preceded and influenced (Eastern, Egyptian, Greek, Etruscan and Roman), the arts of the early Christians and Islam.
                        Located in the 1st district of Paris, on the right bank between the Seine and the Rue de Rivoli, the museum is indicated by the glass pyramid of its reception hall, erected in 1989 in the Napoleon courtyard and which has become iconic , while the equestrian statue of Louis XIV is the starting point of the historic axis of Paris.
                        In 2017, with around 8.1 million visitors a year, the Louvre is the most visited museum in the world. It is the most visited paying cultural site in France. Among his most famous pieces are The Mona Lisa, The Venus of Milo, The Crouching Scribe, The Victory of Samothrace and the Code of Hammurabi.
                        The Louvre has a long history of artistic and historical conservation, from the Ancien RÃ©gime to the present day. Following the departure of Louis XIV for the castle of Versailles at the end of the seventeenth century, part of the royal collections of paintings and antique sculptures are stored there. 
                        After having hosted for a century several academies including that of painting and sculpture, as well as various artists housed by the king, the former royal palace was truly transformed under the Revolution into "Central Museum of the arts of the Republic." He opened in 1793 exhibiting about 660 works, 
                        mainly from royal collections or confiscated from emigrated nobles or churches. Subsequently the collections will continue to be enriched by war, acquisitions, patronage, bequests, donations, and archaeological discoveries.
